# 🧠 Machine Learning Architecture

### Model Type
Classification Model (Random Forest / Logistic Regression)

### Input Representation
- One-hot encoded deck vectors
- Format example:
  - A_26000021 → Player A has Hog Rider  
  - B_26000021 → Player B has Hog Rider  

### Output
- Probability Player A wins  
- Probability Player B wins

# 🛡 Counter Deck Logic

Instead of training a second ML model, ClashWiz uses a Monte Carlo Search strategy:

1. Generate random candidate decks  
2. Simulate battle vs enemy deck  
3. Use trained ML model to compute win probability  
4. Repeat hundreds of times  
5. Return deck with highest win chance  

This converts the prediction model into a recommendation engine.
